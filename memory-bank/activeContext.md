# Active Context - Coverity Agent

## Current Work Focus

### Active Task: Implement Code Retriever Core Components (Task 6)

**Current Phase**: Core component implementation  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Task 3 (ParsedDefect Dataclass) - ✅ Complete

### Recent Achievements
- ✅ Issue Parser foundation completely implemented with CoverityReportTool integration
- ✅ ParsedDefect dataclass created with full serialization support
- ✅ CoverityPipelineAdapter implemented for bridging existing tools
- ✅ Configuration bridge and unit tests completed
- ✅ Memory Bank system established for project context

### Current Implementation Focus

**Code Retriever Components to Build:**
1. **SourceFileManager** - File reading and encoding detection
2. **LanguageParser** - Language detection and basic parsing
3. **ContextAnalyzer** - Integration with classification hints from Issue Parser
4. **CodeContext** - Data structure for output to LLM Fix Generator

### Technical Context for Current Work

**Integration Points:**
- Input: `ParsedDefect` objects from Issue Parser (dependency satisfied)
- Output: `CodeContext` objects for LLM Fix Generator
- Configuration: Leveraging existing `config.py` pattern from Issue Parser

**Key Requirements for Code Retriever:**
- Extract function-level context around defect locations
- Handle file encoding detection and caching efficiently
- Adaptive context sizing based on classification hints
- Memory-efficient processing for large files
- Foundation for multiple language support (C/C++ priority)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Create `src/code_retriever/` directory structure
2. Implement `SourceFileManager` class for file operations
3. Build `LanguageParser` for C/C++ support
4. Create `ContextAnalyzer` with ParsedDefect integration
5. Design `CodeContext` data structure
6. Add configuration integration

### Following Sessions
1. Implement comprehensive unit tests for Code Retriever
2. Integration testing with Issue Parser outputs
3. Performance optimization for large file processing
4. Begin LLM Fix Generator foundation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Using similar module structure as Issue Parser for consistency
- Following dataclass pattern established in `data_structures.py`
- Integrating with existing configuration system
- Memory-efficient streaming approach for large files

### Open Questions
- Context window sizing strategy (adaptive vs. fixed)
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed files
- Language detection accuracy requirements
- Error handling for malformed source files

### Performance Targets
- Context extraction time <500ms per defect
- Function boundary detection >98% accuracy
- Memory usage remains stable for large files
- Extract meaningful context for >95% of test defects

## Current Codebase State

**Completed Components:**
- Issue Parser: Fully functional with comprehensive testing
- Data Structures: ParsedDefect and supporting classes ready
- Configuration: Bridge layer implemented
- Testing Infrastructure: Unit test framework established

**Ready for Integration:**
- ParsedDefect objects provide all necessary input data
- Configuration system ready for Code Retriever settings
- Test patterns established for consistent implementation

The foundation is solid for implementing the Code Retriever, with clear interfaces and well-tested dependencies.
