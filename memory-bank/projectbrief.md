# Coverity Agent - Automated Code Defect Resolution System

## Project Purpose

The Coverity Agent is an intelligent automated system that analyzes Coverity static analysis output, identifies code defects, and automatically generates verified fixes. The system creates a complete pipeline from defect detection to verified code patches using Large Language Models.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
- Parse Coverity static analysis reports into structured data
- Extract relevant source code context around defects
- Generate intelligent code fixes using LLMs (GPT/Claude)
- Apply patches safely with Git integration
- Verify that fixes actually resolve the original issues

### Success Criteria
- >85% successful defect resolution rate
- <5% introduction of new defects
- Support for top 20 Coverity defect types
- Process 100+ defects per hour
- Seamless Git workflow integration

## System Architecture

Pipeline flow: `Coverity Output → Issue Parser → Code Retriever → LLM Fix Generator → Patch Applier → Verification`

### Core Components
1. **Issue Parser** - Parse Coverity reports into structured defect data
2. **Code Retriever** - Extract source code context around defects
3. **LLM Fix Generator** - Generate code patches using AI
4. **Patch Applier** - Apply fixes with Git integration
5. **Verification System** - Validate fix effectiveness

## Technical Scope

### Language Support
- Primary: C/C++ (MVP focus)
- Future: Java, Python, JavaScript

### Integration Requirements
- Coverity Connect API integration
- OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude APIs
- Git repository management via GitPython
- YAML-based configuration system

### Development Approach
- File-based pipeline architecture
- Standardized data structures across components
- Event-driven processing with error handling
- Comprehensive testing and rollback mechanisms

This project represents a strategic investment in automated code quality improvement, leveraging modern AI capabilities to handle routine defect resolution while maintaining human oversight for complex cases.
