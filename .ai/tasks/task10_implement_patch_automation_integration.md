## Description

Build automation capabilities including Perforce triggers integration, batch processing for multiple patches, code review automation, and advanced conflict resolution strategies.

## Details

- **Perforce Triggers Integration**: Seamless integration with Perforce workflow automation
  - Pre-submit triggers for patch validation and safety checks (for manual review process)
  - Post-changelist triggers for automated testing and verification
  - Form-in/form-out triggers for changelist description validation
  - Configurable trigger activation and customization options
  - Integration with existing project Perforce triggers without conflicts

- **Batch Processing System**: Efficient handling of multiple patches
  - Queue-based batch processing for high-volume patch application
  - Intelligent scheduling and prioritization of patch application
  - Parallel processing capabilities for independent patches
  - Progress tracking and reporting for batch operations
  - Error handling and recovery for failed batch items
  - Support for 100+ patches per hour as specified in requirements

- **Code Review Automation**: Automated code review preparation and management
  - Prepare changelists for code review with comprehensive context
  - Generate review requests with defect information and fix details
  - Integration with Perforce Swarm, Review Board, or other review tools
  - Automated changelist description generation with comprehensive context
  - Support for reviewer suggestions and assignment
  - Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing (pre-submit)

- **Advanced Conflict Resolution**: Sophisticated conflict handling strategies
  - Machine learning-based conflict resolution suggestions
  - Context-aware resolution strategies based on code analysis
  - Interactive conflict resolution with developer guidance
  - Historical pattern analysis for conflict resolution learning
  - Support for complex multi-file conflict scenarios
  - Integration with external merge tools and IDEs

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate complex patch application workflows
  - Multi-stage patch application with validation checkpoints
  - Integration with code review processes and approval workflows
  - Automated rollback triggers based on test failures or issues
  - Support for different deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
  - Integration with project management tools and issue trackers

- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure efficient operation at scale
  - Optimize for large repositories (>100k files) as per requirements
  - Intelligent caching and indexing for faster operations
  - Resource usage monitoring and optimization
  - Concurrent operation management and throttling
  - Memory-efficient processing for large patch sets

## Test Strategy

- **Automation Tests**:
  - Test Perforce triggers integration with various trigger configurations
  - Test batch processing with different queue sizes and priorities
  - Test code review automation with multiple review platforms
  - Test workflow orchestration with complex multi-stage scenarios

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Load testing with 100+ patches per hour requirement
  - Large repository testing (>100k files) as specified in NFRs
  - Concurrent processing tests with multiple parallel operations
  - Memory usage and resource optimization validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end testing of complete automation workflows
  - Integration testing with CI/CD pipelines and external tools
  - Testing with real-world repository structures and workflows
  - Cross-platform compatibility testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)

- **Error Handling Tests**:
  - Network failure scenarios during PR creation
  - Repository corruption during batch processing
  - External service outages and fallback mechanisms
  - Complex conflict resolution edge cases

## Agent Notes

This task focuses on automation and scalability. Ensure robust error handling and graceful degradation when external services are unavailable. Pay special attention to performance requirements and large-scale operation capabilities. CRITICAL: Never auto-submit changelists - only prepare them for human review and approval.
