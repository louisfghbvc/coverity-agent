### Description

This task involves two key activities:
1.  **Install Python Packages**: Create a `requirements.txt` file and install `deepagents`, `langchain`, `langchain_core`, and `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`.
2.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Ensure that `NVIDIA_API_KEY` and `NIM_ENDPOINT_URL` are set correctly in the development environment so the agent can authenticate with the NIM service.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   A `requirements.txt` file exists in the project root.
-   All required packages can be installed successfully using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   A test script can successfully import from all installed libraries.
-   The environment variables for NVIDIA NIM are documented and can be loaded by the application.
