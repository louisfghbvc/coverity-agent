# Task 6: Test and Evaluate

**Objective**: Systematically test the agent's performance on a controlled set of Coverity errors and iterate on its design.

**Parent Plan**: [PLAN.md](../plans/PLAN.md)

**Status**: To Do

**Assignee**:

**Dependencies**:
-   Task 5: Assemble Agent

---

### Description

To ensure the agent is effective, it must be tested rigorously. This task involves:
1.  **Creating a Testbed**: Prepare a small, sample C/C++ project with a known set of 2-3 different types of Coverity errors.
2.  **Execution**: Run the fully assembled agent against this testbed.
3.  **Evaluation**: Analyze the agent's performance. Does it correctly identify the errors? Is the generated fix correct? Does it successfully apply the patch? Does the verification loop work?
4.  **Iteration**: Based on the evaluation, refine the agent's instructions, tool design, or even the choice of model if necessary. The goal is to improve its success rate.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   A dedicated test project with known vulnerabilities exists.
-   The agent is run against the test project, and its complete conversational history (trace) is logged.
-   A performance summary is written, documenting which errors were fixed successfully and which were not.
-   At least one cycle of iteration is completed, leading to a demonstrable improvement in the agent's performance.
