# Project Tasks

- [x] **ID 1: Copy and Integrate Existing CoverityReportTool** (Priority: critical)
> Extract and adapt existing comprehensive Coverity analysis tool for the pipeline architecture

- [x] **ID 2: Create CoverityPipelineAdapter** (Priority: critical)
> Dependencies: 1
> Build adapter layer to bridge existing CoverityReportTool with pipeline data structures

- [x] **ID 3: Create ParsedDefect Dataclass** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 1
> Design pipeline-compatible data structure for standardized defect representation

- [x] **ID 4: Create Configuration Bridge** (Priority: medium)
> Dependencies: 1, 2
> Implement configuration adapter to integrate existing tool settings with pipeline config

- [x] **ID 5: Create Unit Tests for Adapter Layer** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 2, 3
> Develop comprehensive test suite for adapter components and data structure conversion

- [x] **ID 6: Implement Code Retriever Core Components** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 3
> Implement the Code Retriever component to extract relevant source code context around defects for LLM Fix Generator. This includes source file management, function-level context extraction, language detection, and integration with classification hints from Issue Parser.

- [x] **ID 7: Implement LLM Fix Generator with NVIDIA NIM Integration** (Priority: critical)
> Dependencies: 3, 6
> Implement the central AI-powered component that analyzes defects, performs intelligent classification, and generates concrete code patches using NVIDIA Inference Microservices. This unified component replaces separate classification and fix planning by leveraging NIM for end-to-end defect analysis and resolution with advanced prompt engineering and multi-candidate generation.
