# Project Tasks

- [x] **ID 1: Copy and Integrate Existing CoverityReportTool** (Priority: critical)
> Extract and adapt existing comprehensive Coverity analysis tool for the pipeline architecture

- [x] **ID 2: Create CoverityPipelineAdapter** (Priority: critical)
> Dependencies: 1
> Build adapter layer to bridge existing CoverityReportTool with pipeline data structures

- [x] **ID 3: Create ParsedDefect Dataclass** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 1
> Design pipeline-compatible data structure for standardized defect representation

- [x] **ID 4: Create Configuration Bridge** (Priority: medium)
> Dependencies: 1, 2
> Implement configuration adapter to integrate existing tool settings with pipeline config

- [x] **ID 5: Create Unit Tests for Adapter Layer** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 2, 3
> Develop comprehensive test suite for adapter components and data structure conversion

- [x] **ID 6: Implement Code Retriever Core Components** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 3
> Implement the Code Retriever component to extract relevant source code context around defects for LLM Fix Generator. This includes source file management, function-level context extraction, language detection, and integration with classification hints from Issue Parser.

- [x] **ID 7: Implement LLM Fix Generator with NVIDIA NIM Integration** (Priority: critical)
> Dependencies: 3, 6
> Implement the central AI-powered component that analyzes defects, performs intelligent classification, and generates concrete code patches using NVIDIA Inference Microservices. This unified component leverages dotenv-based configuration management for secure API token handling, with NIM as primary provider and OpenAI/Anthropic fallbacks. Features include advanced prompt engineering optimized for NIM models, multi-candidate generation, and comprehensive cost optimization strategies.

- [ ] **ID 8: Implement Core Patch Application Engine** (Priority: critical)
> Dependencies: 7
> Implement the foundational patch application system with safe validation, file backup mechanisms, and basic Perforce integration for applying generated patches to target codebases.

- [ ] **ID 12: Implement Core Verification System** (Priority: critical)
> Dependencies: 8
> Implement the foundational verification system with Coverity interface, basic defect comparison logic, compilation validation, and simple before/after reporting to validate that applied fixes actually resolve defects.

- [ ] **ID 13: Implement Advanced Verification Analysis** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 12
> Add sophisticated defect matching algorithms, new defect detection and classification, related defect impact analysis, and incremental analysis optimization for comprehensive verification.

- [ ] **ID 14: Implement Verification Metrics and Reporting** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 13
> Build comprehensive metrics calculation, success rate tracking, detailed verification reports, and historical trend analysis to measure fix effectiveness over time.

- [ ] **ID 15: Add Production-Grade Verification Features** (Priority: medium)
> Dependencies: 14
> Implement production-ready verification features including performance optimization for large codebases, comprehensive error handling, integration testing, and monitoring capabilities.

- [ ] **ID 9: Implement Advanced Perforce Features for Patch Management** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 15
> Add advanced Perforce integration features including automated changelist management, changelist description generation, conflict detection and basic resolution, and workspace state management. Note: Only prepare changelists for human review - no auto-submit.

- [ ] **ID 10: Implement Patch Automation and Integration Features** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 9
> Build automation capabilities including Perforce triggers integration, batch processing for multiple patches, code review automation, and advanced conflict resolution strategies.

- [ ] **ID 11: Add Production-Grade Patch Applier Features** (Priority: medium)
> Dependencies: 10
> Implement production-ready features including comprehensive error handling, performance optimization, monitoring and logging capabilities, and complete integration testing suite.
