# Fix Generator (LLM) - Feature Plan

## Overview
Generate concrete code patches using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on structured fix plans, code context, and defect information. This component translates high-level fix strategies into actual, compilable code changes.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Generate code patches using GPT-4/Claude integration
- **FR2**: Support multiple LLM providers with fallback mechanisms
- **FR3**: Generate multiple fix candidates for comparison
- **FR4**: Maintain code style consistency with existing codebase
- **FR5**: Provide confidence scores for generated patches
- **FR6**: Handle multi-file fixes and complex refactoring
- **FR7**: Support incremental fix generation and refinement
- **FR8**: Generate explanatory comments for generated fixes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: Generate patches for 50+ defects per minute
- **NFR2**: Maintain <10% LLM API failure rate
- **NFR3**: Optimize token usage for cost efficiency
- **NFR4**: Support offline/local LLM deployment options
- **NFR5**: Ensure generated code security and safety
