# Coverity Agent - Automated Code Defect Resolution System

## Project Overview

The Coverity Agent is an intelligent automated system designed to analyze Coverity static analysis output, identify code defects, and automatically generate and verify fixes. This system creates a complete pipeline from defect detection to verified code patches.

## System Architecture

This is a complex multi-component system requiring careful integration and data flow management:

```
Coverity Output → Issue Parser → Issue Classifier → Code Retriever
                                        ↓
Verification ← Patch Applier ← Fix Generator (LLM) ← Fix Planner
```

## Core Components

### 1. Issue Parser
**Purpose**: Parse and extract structured information from Coverity defect reports
**Input**: Coverity JSON/XML output files
**Output**: Structured defect data objects
**Key Features**:
- Support multiple Coverity output formats
- Extract defect location, type, severity, and context
- Handle batch processing of multiple reports

### 2. Issue Classifier  
**Purpose**: Categorize defects into specific problem types for targeted fixing
**Input**: Structured defect data from Issue Parser
**Output**: Classified defect objects with fix strategy hints
**Key Features**:
- Classify null pointer dereference issues
- Identify uninitialized value problems
- Categorize memory leaks and resource management issues
- Support extensible classification rules

### 3. Code Retriever
**Purpose**: Locate and extract relevant source code context for each defect
**Input**: Defect location information
**Output**: Source code snippets with context
**Key Features**:
- Extract function-level context around defects
- Include related dependencies and declarations  
- Handle multiple file scenarios
- Provide syntax-highlighted code context

### 4. Fix Planner
**Purpose**: Develop fix strategies based on defect classification
**Input**: Classified defects with code context
**Output**: Structured fix plans and templates
**Key Features**:
- Pattern-based fix strategy selection
- Template generation for common fix patterns
- Risk assessment for proposed fixes
- Integration with coding standards

### 5. Fix Generator (LLM)
**Purpose**: Generate actual code patches using Large Language Models
**Input**: Fix plans and code context
**Output**: Concrete code patches
**Key Features**:
- GPT/Claude integration for intelligent code generation
- Context-aware patch generation
- Multiple fix candidate generation
- Code style consistency maintenance

### 6. Patch Applier + Git Hook
**Purpose**: Apply generated patches and create version control integration
**Input**: Generated patches and target repository
**Output**: Applied changes with Git integration
**Key Features**:
- Safe patch application with rollback capability
- Git commit creation with descriptive messages
- Diff generation and review preparation
- Conflict detection and resolution

### 7. Verification System
**Purpose**: Validate that applied fixes actually resolve the original issues
**Input**: Modified code and original defect information
**Output**: Verification results and success metrics
**Key Features**:
- Re-run Coverity analysis on modified code
- Compare before/after defect reports
- Generate fix success metrics
- Identify any new issues introduced

## Technical Integration Requirements
