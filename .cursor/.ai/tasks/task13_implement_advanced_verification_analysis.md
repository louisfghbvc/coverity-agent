## Details

- **Sophisticated Defect Matching Algorithms**: Enhance defect comparison accuracy
  - Advanced defect matching with tolerance for code refactoring
  - Context-aware matching considering surrounding code changes
  - Function signature and semantic analysis for better matching
  - Machine learning-based similarity scoring for defect correlation
  - Handle complex code transformations and optimizations
  - Support for cross-file defect relationships and dependencies

- **New Defect Detection and Classification**: Identify newly introduced issues
  - Comprehensive detection of defects introduced by patches
  - Classification of new defects by severity and impact
  - Risk assessment for newly introduced issues
  - False positive reduction through pattern analysis
  - Integration with existing defect classification systems
  - Support for different sensitivity levels (low, medium, high)

- **Related Defect Impact Analysis**: Analyze broader impact of changes
  - Identify defects in related code that might be affected by patches
  - Analysis of dependencies and call graph relationships
  - Detection of secondary effects from primary defect fixes
  - Cross-module impact assessment for complex fixes
  - Historical pattern analysis for related defect prediction
  - Integration with code analysis tools for dependency mapping

- **Incremental Analysis Optimization**: Improve performance for large codebases

  - Selective re-analysis based on change impact
  - Resource usage optimization for concurrent operations
  - Integration with build system dependency tracking

- **Advanced Comparison Engine**: Enhanced result analysis capabilities
  - Multi-dimensional defect comparison (location, type, severity)
  - Trend analysis for defect pattern evolution
  - Confidence scoring for verification results
  - Statistical analysis of fix effectiveness
  - Integration with historical defect data
  - Support for custom comparison rules and policies

- **Performance Optimization**: Meet strict performance requirements
