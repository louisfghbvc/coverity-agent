## Description

Add advanced Perforce integration features including automated changelist management, changelist description generation, conflict detection and basic resolution, and workspace state management.

## Details

- **Changelist Management Automation**: Implement intelligent changelist creation and management
  - Create numbered changelists with standardized descriptions (e.g., `Coverity Fix: Defect {id}`)
  - Validate workspace state before changelist operations
  - Use `p4 edit` to prepare files for modification
  - Track and manage multiple concurrent fix changelists (ready for human review)

- **Changelist Description Generation**: Generate descriptive, standardized changelist descriptions
  - Template-based description system with defect information
  - Include defect ID, type, affected files, and fix strategy
  - Support for customizable description templates
  - Metadata embedding for traceability (confidence scores, fix strategies)

- **Conflict Detection and Basic Resolution**: Handle Perforce conflicts intelligently
  - Detect conflicts before and during patch application
  - Implement basic conflict resolution strategies (auto-resolve, prefer-patch, prefer-original)
  - Provide detailed conflict reports for manual review when needed
  - Use `p4 resolve` for conflict resolution workflow

- **Workspace State Management**: Comprehensive Perforce workspace management
  - Monitor and validate workspace sync state
  - Handle opened files appropriately
  - Use `p4 revert` for rollback when necessary
  - Ensure consistent workspace state throughout patch application process

- **Perforce Integration Enhancement**: Extend Perforce Manager from Phase 1
  - Advanced Perforce workspace validation and health checks
  - Support for different Perforce workflows (streams, traditional branching)
  - Integration with existing Perforce triggers and workflows
  - Workspace backup and restoration capabilities

- **Patch History Tracking**: Maintain detailed patch application history
  - Track applied patches with changelist associations
  - Generate patch application reports
  - Support for patch rollback using `p4 revert` and changelist management
  - Integration with Perforce history for audit trails

## Test Strategy

- **Perforce Workflow Tests**:
  - Test changelist creation with various workspace states
  - Test changelist description generation with different defect types and metadata
  - Test conflict detection and resolution with simulated conflict scenarios
  - Test workspace state management with opened files

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test complete Perforce workflow from `p4 edit` to changelist creation
  - Test patch application with conflict resolution in real workspaces
  - Test rollback capabilities using `p4 revert`
  - Test integration with existing Perforce triggers and workflows

- **Edge Case Tests**:
  - Test with corrupted Perforce workspaces
  - Test with large workspaces and complex file structures
  - Test concurrent patch applications in different changelists
  - Test with various Perforce server configurations and settings

## Agent Notes

This task builds upon the core patch application engine to add sophisticated Perforce integration. Focus on robust conflict handling and seamless integration with existing Perforce workflows. Remember: DO NOT auto-submit changelists - only prepare them for human review and approval.
