## Description

Implements the foundational patch application system components including patch validation, backup management, and basic Perforce integration. This is the core infrastructure needed for safe patch application.

## Implementation Details

### **Core Components to Implement**

1. **Patch Validator Component**:
   - Validate file existence and permissions
   - Check patch format and structure from `DefectAnalysisResult`
   - Detect conflicts with working directory
   - Return detailed validation results with errors and warnings

2. **Backup Manager**:
   - Create backups of all files before modification
   - Generate backup manifests with timestamps and file mappings
   - Implement backup restoration capabilities
   - Organize backups by patch ID for easy identification

3. **Perforce Manager Foundation**:
   - Validate Perforce workspace state before operations
   - Use `p4 edit` to prepare files for modification
   - Basic Perforce status and workspace checking
   - Foundation for advanced Perforce features

4. **Safety Framework**:
   - Rollback capabilities for failed applications (`p4 revert`)
   - Validation of target workspace state
   - Error handling and recovery procedures
   - Logging of all operations for audit trail

5. **Configuration System**:
   - YAML-based configuration for patch applier settings
   - Safety and backup configuration options
   - Perforce workspace and client configuration settings

## Test Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- Test patch validation with various `DefectAnalysisResult` formats
- Test backup creation and restoration processes
- Test Perforce workspace state validation
- Test rollback mechanisms with simulated failures

### **Integration Tests**
- Test with actual `DefectAnalysisResult` from Fix Generator
- Test Perforce integration with various workspace states
- Test backup/restore cycle integrity

## Success Criteria

- All core components implemented and testable
- Unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- Integration with Fix Generator `DefectAnalysisResult` verified
- Basic Perforce operations (edit, revert) working
- Backup and restore functionality validated

## Agent Notes

Focus on solid core implementation with comprehensive error handling. This provides the foundation for task 8b's pipeline integration.
