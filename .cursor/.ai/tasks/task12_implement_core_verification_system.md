## Description

Implement the foundational verification system with Coverity interface, basic defect comparison logic, compilation validation, and simple before/after reporting to validate that applied fixes actually resolve defects.

## Details

- **Coverity Interface Component**: Create comprehensive Coverity integration system
  - Interface with Coverity command-line tools (cov-build, cov-analyze, cov-commit)
  - Run incremental analysis on modified files for performance
  - Handle Coverity project configuration and stream management
  - Support both local analysis and server-based analysis workflows
  - Extract and parse Coverity analysis results and reports

- **Basic Defect Comparison Logic**: Implement core defect matching and comparison
  - Compare before/after defect reports from Coverity analysis
  - Identify if target defect was successfully resolved
  - Basic defect matching based on file path, line number, checker type, and function
  - Handle line number shifts and minor code changes during matching
  - Generate simple comparison results with success/failure status

- **Compilation Validator**: Ensure modified code compiles successfully
  - Validate compilation with multiple build configurations
  - Run basic functionality tests if configured
  - Handle build timeouts and error conditions
  - Support for different build systems (make, cmake, etc.)
  - Generate detailed build logs and error reports

- **Before/After Reporting**: Generate simple verification reports
  - Document target defect resolution status
  - List any compilation issues or build failures
  - Basic metrics on verification success/failure
  - Simple report format (JSON/text) for downstream consumption
  - Integration with existing logging and reporting infrastructure

- **Configuration System**: Basic verification configuration management
  - YAML-based configuration for Coverity settings
  - Build command and test command configuration
  - Timeout and performance tuning settings
  - Integration with existing project configuration

- **Error Handling Framework**: Robust error management for verification process
  - Handle Coverity analysis failures gracefully
  - Manage build environment issues and dependencies
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit trails
  - Recovery mechanisms for partial failures

## Test Strategy

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test Coverity interface with mock analysis results
  - Test defect comparison logic with known before/after scenarios
  - Test compilation validation with various build configurations
  - Test error handling with simulated failure conditions

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test complete verification workflow with real Coverity installation
  - Test with actual defect scenarios and known fixes
  - Test compilation validation with real build systems
  - Test integration with patch application system

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test incremental analysis performance with large codebases
  - Test verification time requirements (<15 minutes per patch)
  - Test resource usage during analysis and compilation
  - Test concurrent verification operations

## Agent Notes

This task establishes the foundation for automated verification. Focus on reliable Coverity integration and accurate defect comparison logic. Ensure robust error handling since verification results are critical for the patch approval process.
