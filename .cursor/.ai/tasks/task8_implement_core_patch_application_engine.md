## Description

Implement the foundational patch application system with safe validation, file backup mechanisms, and basic Perforce integration for applying generated patches to target codebases.

## Details

- **Patch Validator Component**: Create comprehensive validation system for patches before application
  - Validate file existence and permissions
  - Check patch format and structure
  - Detect conflicts with working directory
  - Return detailed validation results with errors and warnings

- **Basic Patch Application**: Implement core patch application functionality
  - Apply patches safely to target files
  - Handle text-based patches with proper line-by-line application
  - Support multiple file modifications in single patch

- **Backup Manager**: Create comprehensive backup system for safety
  - Create backups of all files before modification
  - Generate backup manifests with timestamps and file mappings
  - Implement backup restoration capabilities
  - Organize backups by patch ID for easy identification

- **Perforce Manager Foundation**: Build basic Perforce integration
  - Validate Perforce workspace state before operations
  - Use `p4 edit` to prepare files for modification
  - Basic Perforce status and workspace checking
  - Foundation for advanced Perforce features in later phases

- **Safety Framework**: Implement comprehensive safety mechanisms
  - Rollback capabilities for failed applications (p4 revert)
  - Validation of target workspace state
  - Error handling and recovery procedures
  - Logging of all operations for audit trail

- **Configuration System**: Basic configuration management
  - YAML-based configuration for patch applier settings
  - Safety and backup configuration options
  - Perforce workspace and client configuration settings

## Test Strategy

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test patch validation with various invalid patch formats
  - Test backup creation and restoration processes
  - Test patch application on sample files with known expected results
  - Test Perforce workspace state validation and error conditions

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test complete patch application workflow from validation to completion
  - Test rollback scenarios with intentional failures (p4 revert)
  - Test with actual generated patches from Fix Generator component
  - Test with various Perforce workspace states and configurations

- **Safety Tests**:
  - Test backup system integrity and restoration accuracy
  - Test rollback capabilities after failed patch applications
  - Test error handling with corrupted or invalid patches
  - Test with large files and complex patches

## Agent Notes

This task establishes the critical foundation for safe patch application. Focus on safety mechanisms and comprehensive validation before implementing advanced features in subsequent phases.
