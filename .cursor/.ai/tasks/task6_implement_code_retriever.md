## Description

Implement the Code Retriever component to extract relevant source code context around defects for LLM Fix Generator. This includes source file management, function-level context extraction, language detection, and integration with classification hints from Issue Parser.

## Details

- **Phase 1 Core Components:**
  - Implement `SourceFileManager` class for file reading and encoding detection
  - Create `LanguageParser` for basic language detection and parsing
  - Build `ContextAnalyzer` with classification hints integration
  - Implement `CodeContext` data structure for output

- **Key Features:**
  - Extract function-level context around defect locations
  - Handle file encoding detection and caching
  - Support adaptive context sizing based on classification hints
  - Implement basic cross-file dependency tracking
  - Create foundation for multiple language support (start with C/C++)

- **Integration Requirements:**
  - Accept `ParsedDefect` objects with classification hints from Issue Parser
  - Output `CodeContext` objects for LLM Fix Generator consumption
  - Leverage classification hints for intelligent context extraction

- **MVP Focus:**
  - Prioritize C/C++ support as primary target
  - Implement basic function boundary detection
  - Create simple pattern detection for common defect types
  - Ensure memory-efficient processing for large files

- **File Structure:**
  ```
  src/code_retriever/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── source_file_manager.py
  ├── language_parser.py  
  ├── context_analyzer.py
  ├── data_structures.py
  └── config.py
  ```

- **Configuration Integration:**
  - Support configurable context window sizes
  - Enable/disable classification hint usage
  - Language-specific settings and parsers
  - Performance optimization settings

## Test Strategy

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test file reading with various encodings
  - Validate function boundary detection accuracy
  - Test context size adaptation based on hints
  - Verify language detection correctness

- **Integration Tests:**
  - End-to-end context extraction with real defect data
  - Integration with ParsedDefect objects from Issue Parser
  - Performance testing with large source files
  - Memory usage validation

- **Test Files:**
  - Create sample C/C++ files with known defects
  - Test with various file encodings (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.)
  - Include edge cases: very large files, malformed code
  - Test classification hint integration

- **Success Criteria:**
  - Extract meaningful context for >95% of test defects
  - Function boundary detection >98% accuracy
  - Context extraction time <500ms per defect
  - Memory usage remains stable for large files
